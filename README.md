# BotCoreLCMTypes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaRobotics/BotCoreLCMTypes.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaRobotics/BotCoreLCMTypes.jl)

This is a wrapper package for [openhumanoids/bot_core_lcmtypes](https://github.com/openhumanoids/bot_core_lcmtypes), designed to make it easier to install and import those types inside Julia. As with [PyLCM.jl](https://github.com/rdeits/PyLCM.jl), it uses PyCall to wrap the Python LCM type definitions.
